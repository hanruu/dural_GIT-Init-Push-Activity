    <h1>RASPBERRYPI</h1>
    <p>Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the United Kingdom. It is a low-cost, high-performance computer that aims to make computing and digital making more accessible to people around the world. The Raspberry Pi is popular for learning programming skills, building hardware projects, home automation, and industrial applications. It runs on Linux and provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins, allowing users to interact with the physical world. The price point for Raspberry Pi has always been under $100, with the most affordable model, the Pi Zero, costing just $5. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a charity with a mission to enable young people to realize their full potential through the power of computing and digital technologies.
